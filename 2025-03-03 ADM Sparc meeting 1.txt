[0.88s - 7.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, I'll give you a call afterwards. Yeah, I just realized I just discovered that that letter didn't get signed so
[9.18s - 11.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Okay, we'll be later. All right
[13.66s - 19.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, yeah, so good morning everyone. Yeah, so this is the first chance kind of getting the full the full almost the full set of partners
[19.68s - 22.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I don't think we have that we know Tatiana on from an L
[22.30s - 27.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: But we do have our national labs is also agreed to participate doing the TDA and LCA
[27.06s - 31.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: So we'll get her looped in and later in later parts as well, but
[32.90s - 33.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, so
[34.72s - 40.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The first chance to get the full team together talk through the overall project concept and the narrative for it
[40.92s - 46.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I'm asking questions that we have kind of in run through things also just to kind of get the chance of the people
[46.16s - 48.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: They'll be working on to meet the people that we're working on this
[49.74s - 51.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Well first the I thought we you know
[51.94s - 57.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We at the ATM when we especially especially bigger meetings. We like to start off our meetings with a safety moment
[58.38s - 61.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So we'll start there and then we'll run through some run through some
[61.18s - 61.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: agenda
[62.44s - 67.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We'll run through some introductions and then I'll pull up the the document I sent around this morning
[67.94s - 73.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And we will and we'll kind of use that as a as a talking point and take some notes in there as we go through
[74.26s - 76.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: There's anything points people want to make but
[77.78s - 78.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, so
[79.62s - 81.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: With that with lots of paper to cover
[81.22s - 87.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Dive into just safety moment and this is I'm pretty sure that the Schrooom million teams is well aware of this
[87.46s - 90.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But I'm just from a from a view of people that don't work with accolades all the time
[91.62s - 95.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Though I think the topic for a safety moment quick safety moment is chemical sensitization
[96.34s - 99.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Accolates especially some of the lore month the way it accolates
[100.26s - 101.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Monomers are strong sensitizers
[101.90s - 109.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: sensitizers and that can be pretty life-changing if you develop if when you when you develop a sensitivity to something like
[109.38s - 113.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Accolates because of even you know from dental composites to
[113.78s - 118.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Medical adhesive and all sorts of things you can find ways to trigger that sensitivity
[118.94s - 121.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: From you know from working in the lab with these materials, you know
[121.80s - 126.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Chemical hygiene is is very important as well as proper engineering controls around these materials
[127.34s - 131.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Just worth it's worth stressing then you know as we consider a project around accolades
[131.14s - 139.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know just remembering to the to take a look at the SDSs and understand the especially especially with accolates in terms of the severity of
[139.32s - 142.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The possibility to develop a sensitivity to those materials
[143.92s - 149.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, I guess you know, we don't even have any comments on that or if it's you know if the Sherman team is eating to add about kind of
[149.60s - 153.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know kind of common practices about you know about hygiene around accolates
[157.72s - 164.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: I don't think I have anything specifically to add them and just generally in handling because we handle them every day
[165.42s - 171.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: All the accolates that we use we handle in a fume hood. We wear appropriate PPE which always includes
[173.10s - 174.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: nitrile gloves usually
[175.36s - 177.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: and a lab coat as well as
[178.68s - 180.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: Safety glasses of course, so
[181.26s - 187.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: But yeah, they're always handled in a hood if they cannot be handled in a hood for some reason we also do have
[188.78s - 195.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: respirators or in our manufacturing facilities even like the scuba type self-contained breathing apparatus materials
[195.20s - 201.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_10/SPEAKER_11/SPEAKER_14/SPEAKER_18: So definitely important to keep that in mind. So appreciate it there. Yeah, thank you. I
[202.26s - 206.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: With that kind of we go we start with start with introductions
[206.50s - 211.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We'll run around the team everybody do a quick intro. Don't need that probably just more
[211.54s - 213.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, we'll keep it very brief
[213.74s - 217.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: We've got a lot of people so I think it's good to do that with with the group
[218.40s - 224.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I will go ahead and get started. So for those I think everyone has met me, but I'm just a maybe reminder I'm Eric Eckbert

[680.88s - 684.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_06: And uh we're really closely with more of this team where they get a
[684.94s - 694.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_06: About interesting technologies and things that might be useful for us in turn wise to see how we can you know make it useful and find a home for it within
[696.72s - 700.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Great thank you Tom and I think finally Colleen
[701.38s - 707.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Hi everyone my name is Colleen Tahan. I'm new to Sherwin. I've been here about six months

[764.66s - 765.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, thanks everyone
[766.50s - 771.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So what you know I think what we want to want to do is yeah now and I'm about used to just the concept paper
[771.58s - 775.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I know I'm sorry for getting that out late. I should have sent I should have sent what I had on Friday
[776.12s - 779.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I tried to play with a little bit a little bit this weekend didn't have much time though
[780.04s - 785.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But you know they've had a chance to glance at at least in terms of kind of how the concept lays out but
[785.56s - 790.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: My figure will just we'll go ahead and share that share my screen with that and we'll kind of walk through
[791.46s - 795.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Uh make pretty make this make this pretty informal if you've got questions
[795.16s - 799.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You've got comments you've got points that you want to make sure or capture your thoughts
[799.54s - 804.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We can kind of use this as a working session to grab those and I'll probably just go ahead and type those right into the document as
[804.56s - 808.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We're as we're grabbing them so as those come up but
[809.58s - 812.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Anything anything to cover before we dive into that
[816.82s - 821.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_18: Oh, I guess I should just quickly say where are we on the non-disclosure agreement arc
[822.48s - 830.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Uh, NBA is um it is is it is it's signed heart or is it still I think we're we so I think we're still
[830.90s - 836.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think we're still especially with the project I think we're sure try trying to target this as far as
[836.72s - 840.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Trying to stay out of confidential material. Um, I think you know, but so
[841.64s - 848.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_18: All right, and that's yeah, I think heart probably just about to say that uh, he sent you the red line from sure when I'm friday
[848.70s - 857.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_18: So I think it's an ADM scans now to take it over next step. Yeah, we agree. So this conversation today should be held non-confidential. Yeah
[860.26s - 863.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Perfect. Thank you. Thank you Morgan. That was a good reminder
[864.86s - 865.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[866.16s - 873.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, so um as we go working title people got people have a better idea for a title. Um, it's nice to have a good title
[873.58s - 876.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: Especially they can be shortened in acronym that would be awesome
[876.30s - 882.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Otherwise, but that's kind of the you know, basically the title that describes what we want to do or in in general
[882.18s - 888.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So if we've got people please please suggest titles um here if you've um if you've come up with one you think that is
[888.74s - 894.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That has a that is nice and succinct and descriptive and can be made and especially made into a nice acronym
[894.76s - 895.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[896.22s - 902.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: plan is ADM would be lead on this grant as that stands on right now
[902.18s - 906.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Just nominally me probably submitting the grant that may change we'll see
[907.42s - 908.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: but uh
[909.76s - 914.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Team member organizations, ADM, argon, Iowa states and that'll Eric
[914.24s - 918.12s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We can talk about how we want if we want to use the CV squared entity or just want to use Iowa state
[918.12s - 921.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: How we want to do that? Sherman Williams and then you know
[922.06s - 924.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: locations we meet the caterer aims
[925.32s - 931.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The Lamont argon and then in what hair down Morgan and Hart will have to talk about what we want to list for for a show for a show
[931.92s - 932.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: In locations so
[933.72s - 941.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, not not details we have to decide now, but um just kind of pointing out kind of like overall scope of the project that we're starting to look at
[942.30s - 942.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[944.10s - 948.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So the um the what we are proposing to do um
[948.84s - 953.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Mkaiya sort of maybe start off with like in scope out of scope as far as the ADM team is talk so far
[954.28s - 961.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: Right now ADM um we would plan on starting with a strain um so we would we would select one of the strings
[961.30s - 968.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We have developed for three HP um or or more or a couple of strains possibly depending on how how the project evolves and sets up
[968.42s - 975.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We would and we would within the project uh work on developing the fermentation technology
[976.22s - 983.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know in order in a way to minimize the number of byproducts um and to make a lean
[983.98s - 986.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: fermentation that uses a lean minimal media
[987.26s - 991.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: All that in effort to the kind of the core point uh with the to
[992.22s - 1000.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Make sure we're making a clean as possible through HP to minimize the amount of work that we have to do to clean it up
[1000.08s - 1005.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um to and to to be able to to be able to convert it to acrylic acid and minimize them
[1005.02s - 1007.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: minimize the total amount of downstream
[1007.08s - 1008.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um purification
[1009.58s - 1019.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So um, you know at at the start here, you know, you know, really you know the what what the way we see that we're structuring this narrative right now is really around
[1020.30s - 1025.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: significantly um around making uh three HP at acrylic
[1026.52s - 1034.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Ecomamacles inherently from if we take dextrose at average values and and we get to kind of lactic type fermentation yields
[1035.02s - 1039.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: With then very very high conversions of the of the three HP to acrylic acid
[1039.64s - 1043.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um, you know, it's you know on on par with
[1043.68s - 1050.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Propylene to acrylic as far as overall costs right so we can and that that's the next is that's kind of a little bit right up
[1050.22s - 1056.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That i'm i'll be working on we've done some work um on the background on that um but in general
[1056.88s - 1064.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: This looks to be inherently competitive with some major assumptions those major assumptions are one the three HP fermentation yield
[1064.58s - 1071.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Needs to be near where lactic is um that looks achievable and art the team and we and some of those narrative kind of addresses that
[1072.18s - 1077.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um the the next bit is then we can do minimal amount of separations
[1077.58s - 1085.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That is probably where the core a lot of the core of the work will be on the project is around that development of those for of the fermentation media
[1085.28s - 1092.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: minimizing the minimizing the number of impurities and contaminants that we that we have to um
[1092.94s - 1100.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That we need to remove um from from the media and that all is in service of keeping you know when keeping the cost as low as we can right so
[1101.04s - 1107.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: simplicity um, you know some simple steps simplicity is kind of is the goal of the overall overall process
[1107.70s - 1115.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I mean it all and it all really cascades from there um right so the cleaner the three HP we have going into the dehydration
[1115.40s - 1121.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The cleaner the acrylic acid we have the cleaner the acrylic acid we have the cleaner the acrolyte we produce
[1121.48s - 1126.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Right so the minimal minimize overall separations by starting off with the right biology
[1126.90s - 1132.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So kind of higher over and overwriting kind of theme is we have the right biology
[1133.12s - 1139.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And they're connected to the right molecule and the chemistry then follows as a as a simple obvious way to get to
[1139.90s - 1140.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Acrolytes
[1141.56s - 1149.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: There's you know there's a lot more in that but that's kind of that is the that is the base that is the kind of what we've thought about as a theme or kind of a
[1149.94s - 1154.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Kind of the core of the narrative is really driving this around it's an amp you know
[1154.76s - 1160.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: 3 HP with the right KPIs and the right tierities is inherently competitive
[1161.22s - 1165.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Is you know the ocean inherently competitive to acrolyte acrolyte acrylic from purple
[1166.50s - 1171.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, I'll pause there on what kind of on that as an intro and I you know that's um
[1171.00s - 1174.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And that really in me on these first couple paragraphs really kind of
[1174.18s - 1179.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know really kind of our targeted in that this is still again. This is a working draft. I've got
[1179.86s - 1181.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We've got more there
[1181.70s - 1187.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The one thing I do I've got noted in red here. Oh, there's no that in red here is probably need to talk a little bit about
[1187.92s - 1193.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Utilack relate as the target about a dry about driving towards it right so that that front and piece sounds great
[1193.54s - 1199.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But you know what's what would be the driver to really have a bio-based beetle acrolyte so we probably need a little bit of thought on that
[1199.90s - 1202.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_17/SPEAKER_18: And yeah, I'll pause for a second
[1205.22s - 1207.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We comment for farm
[1213.08s - 1214.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_18: Is do we up?
[1215.68s - 1219.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: I was just wondering if if do we had updated its
[1220.42s - 1223.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: interest statement and 3 HP like
[1224.34s - 1230.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Are they like there was like a 2004 steady or report or whatever where it was one of their
[1231.22s - 1236.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: When they're top 12 value added chemicals, but is is it still acrylics is what they're
[1237.18s - 1239.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: They're looking at it. They have some unspoken
[1240.46s - 1240.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Downstream
[1241.60s - 1243.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: app for for this
[1243.96s - 1250.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We we believe well, we've had so there's there's a couple things driving this choice of this project one
[1250.64s - 1255.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: One isn't you know they mentioned 3 HP specifically in the foa um and connecting it to a chemical
[1256.66s - 1259.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The most common the most common one is is acrylic
[1260.26s - 1266.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: There's three things behind why you know why we be proposing that and maybe thinking that there's some connection is
[1266.30s - 1268.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: There was an RFI
[1269.54s - 1277.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: From from bido last summer that we responded to a lot of our discussion was a that we included was around
[1279.00s - 1285.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: C3s and acrylic acid and the challenges with Quasarol and Lactic and kind of in 3 HP
[1285.64s - 1289.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Being kind of a target molecule obviously then 3 HP was on their list before
[1290.04s - 1294.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We also we also has interactions with some folks at national labs
[1295.22s - 1301.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Kind of on the same topic and some subject we know that they took some information and from that we gave and that went into some additional
[1302.60s - 1305.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: In additional background and then um
[1305.96s - 1306.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: during a
[1307.80s - 1308.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Site visit
[1309.16s - 1313.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We had a separate meeting from the from the site visit topic with
[1314.46s - 1318.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: With the DOE staff um that were here on
[1319.32s - 1327.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Around c3 chemicals and our adm is you on c3 chemical so we we so I think there's I think there's a couple themes tied to it
[1327.34s - 1332.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And I don't have it so there's some of the stuff in here. I think looks very much like things we said or wrote
[1333.18s - 1335.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So I think this is again
[1335.46s - 1339.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: As it stood before you know before the new administration
[1339.70s - 1342.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think this was kind of on you know on target of where they wanted to go
[1342.98s - 1349.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think you know just reading the tea leaves. I think it's going to be you know part of this is the fact that of um
[1350.70s - 1357.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: More you know maybe more domestic acrylic acid production um you know the ability to expand acrylic acid production in the United States
[1358.04s - 1365.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: If feedstock security by connecting it to something besides but you know petrochemicals right so that that's that as far as those broader themes
[1365.70s - 1371.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: I think that penny that all still and that fits generally within what the how the photo is written so perfect. Thanks
[1376.74s - 1377.18s] Speaker Unknown: Um
[1377.72s - 1378.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um
[1378.76s - 1385.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, and I know maybe and maybe uh probably um oh you know do we miss christian number four? I think on the intro
[1385.18s - 1392.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So I think I did um my apologies if I did um but maybe christian if you might introduce yourself and maybe if you want to kind of talk to this next little section so
[1394.30s - 1395.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: At charno always right
[1396.40s - 1396.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Um
[1397.54s - 1400.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I want to personally manipulate the uh my senior scientists and
[1400.46s - 1406.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Uh one group and salineering I lead to three hb strain development project as the technical lead
[1407.58s - 1411.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um yeah so this section is basically a
[1411.10s - 1414.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: break background on what people have done in the past
[1415.42s - 1422.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Especially the typical workhouse organisms so the people have used which you typically don't meet the kpi's you need
[1422.74s - 1427.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to be uh financially reliable and um also
[1428.26s - 1430.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Using typical bacterial strains require
[1431.30s - 1431.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um
[1432.94s - 1436.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Neuralization during the production and that re-acidification of the hb which
[1437.48s - 1438.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: basically um
[1439.28s - 1447.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Underminds the whole financial liability of the project so uh so the way we are avoiding it and some people have done in the past is to use these acetal or in these strains
[1448.44s - 1448.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um
[1449.86s - 1455.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So far in the literature that I've seen nobody has achieved the yields that you need to be able to be viable
[1455.96s - 1459.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Um so yeah we're proposing that based on our
[1459.72s - 1464.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_01: Lactagasted kpi's that we were able to achieve with our platform organism
[1465.54s - 1466.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um
[1467.02s - 1472.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We think we should be able to be achieved by the same ones for three hb and that's why this project is viable
[1473.24s - 1476.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um and yeah, it basically talks about our
[1476.84s - 1477.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: pacifist experience
[1479.44s - 1481.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_01: With uh making lactagaslet then
[1481.78s - 1482.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: uh
[1482.96s - 1487.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's purity and low purity profile and it's capability and log scale for limitations
[1488.50s - 1493.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Uh which gives us confidence so we can um achieve something similar for three hb
[1494.32s - 1499.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, and sure everyone's sake um what we what we have done you know so the lactic acid
[1499.68s - 1504.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Our lactic acid chassis that you know the organism that was used that has been
[1504.82s - 1510.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_17/SPEAKER_18: um modified and you know the um and i want to know when you can kind of tell me to talk more about that a little bit
[1510.72s - 1517.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But in terms of what's been done exactly but basically we took that lactic acid what was it be a kind of a state of the art lactic acid producer
[1518.36s - 1525.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And we have done the and i said we feist oens team has done the selling shearing work to turn that into a three hb organism
[1526.16s - 1532.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um and that looks like the benefits that from that lactic organism carry through to three hb and that includes the
[1533.56s - 1538.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: significant reduction in those impurities and co-products that you know all the work that we did to
[1538.30s - 1543.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: To make a very very clean lactic acid fermentation broth all ports over the three hb so far
[1543.46s - 1545.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Don't you want to say anything about that?
[1545.78s - 1547.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Now you got it man. Yep
[1547.90s - 1552.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: When we took one of our most advanced uh strings uh rude enzymes required for one
[1553.82s - 1556.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: uh for making lactic for place those with uh series of enzymes
[1556.64s - 1560.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: required for three hb had to make some deletions
[1560.86s - 1563.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: Um and we're still working on it but no you got it
[1563.56s - 1569.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: Yep and and that's a key part of the narrative in terms of where this stands right so this is part of why we
[1569.18s - 1575.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We might just think about our risk there is that we we know we've done with lactic so far the you know so far everything with the
[1575.70s - 1579.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Michelle machinery says we can do it now with three hb in the exact you know in the same way
[1580.36s - 1585.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um and be able to produce that you know high titers at very very very low levels of impurities so
[1589.90s - 1590.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Okay
[1590.34s - 1596.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um refining right still regardless of the fermentation so it's not the cleanest thing in the world um as far you know
[1596.86s - 1601.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know that so we still have refining to do um staying at low pH um and
[1602.26s - 1608.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Minimizing the periods that come from the biology um our key pieces of that but we still have refined to um
[1608.86s - 1612.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And now Brad or Brennan you guys want to kind of talk through the next next bit so
[1616.20s - 1618.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Maybe just now many Brad or Brennan yeah but
[1618.50s - 1627.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_12/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, I was just trying to to put together all the the um
[1628.06s - 1632.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Different proposed routes to get from the three hb to the acrylics
[1632.96s - 1635.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: um, you know multiple things have been published
[1635.30s - 1637.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: I know Brennan is a lot of work also on the acting background
[1637.90s - 1639.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: But this is just talking about the different
[1640.50s - 1645.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Um commercial process is both for lactic acid which could be like a kind of a placeholder
[1645.86s - 1646.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Um
[1646.80s - 1650.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Some of the processes we looked at is like a reactive extraction we believe
[1651.22s - 1657.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Cargo to be using that one and the downfalls with that you know the the heavy solvents in the high capital with that cost
[1658.26s - 1661.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: A little bit of real high level of what we did with lactic on DSP
[1661.82s - 1666.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: um, which is a very abbreviated process due to the the low pH
[1667.38s - 1670.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: So we were able to just essentially remove the cells
[1670.02s - 1674.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: um by a you know traditional means you know ultrification or whatever
[1675.00s - 1680.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Very minimal ion exchange evaporation and distillation and we were able to make um
[1681.00s - 1684.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_12: Very very iquality polymer grade lactic with that routes that that's one analog we could look at
[1685.58s - 1688.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_12: if we wanted to purify three hp and then
[1689.84s - 1694.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: There's multiple ways to go from three hp to acrylic or three hp to the butyl
[1694.96s - 1696.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: ester to the
[1697.24s - 1701.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Three hb and then i then the hydrate or three hp to acrylic and then sterify
[1701.82s - 1702.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: um
[1703.06s - 1705.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Lots of patents and literature out there about doing that all in
[1706.52s - 1706.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: um
[1706.92s - 1708.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: Paul in one column
[1708.36s - 1712.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: We don't sure if it's really works or not, but there's there's some patents. It's a publication's out there
[1712.22s - 1714.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_12: So these are kind of the thoughts we were looking at
[1716.22s - 1722.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So they put part of the project i think and this is going to be a little bit in terms of as we understand the biology
[1722.02s - 1728.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Understand that you know the what's in there be you be selecting the right piece of chemistry and DSP
[1728.80s - 1734.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know there is some potential thought you know like one one question and this is something to develop a little bit more in detail
[1734.26s - 1743.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: For the full proposal to be um do we do we need to fully refine or can we go ahead and convert um if we've got low amounts of alcohols and means and other kind of things
[1743.80s - 1747.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You'd be you would rob yield can we go ahead and convert
[1747.92s - 1749.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: minimally cleaned up fermentation broth
[1750.70s - 1757.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Into an acrylic or an acrylate and then for them and then purify so that's it's a little bit kind of what the
[1757.18s - 1763.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know, thanks. We are about fit for per respects right so in a lot of the I think a lot of the work plan will be around
[1764.76s - 1770.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Developing what the fit for per respect is for three HP to be able to convert it to it and for to an acrylic that you can clean up
[1771.04s - 1771.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[1771.96s - 1776.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think you know that as far as you know any Eric that's kind of maybe where some of these some of that reaction screening
[1776.98s - 1781.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Is also kind of where your team starts coming in or your folks start coming in uh as uh
[1781.58s - 1786.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: As kind of thinking about what's the right chemistry? What's the right what's the right specifications
[1787.18s - 1790.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: For each type of chemistry that you think about doing a conversion so
[1793.78s - 1794.26s] Speaker Unknown: Um
[1797.60s - 1802.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, so you know improvements and benefits and this is you know, this is kind of organized
[1802.20s - 1804.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: This is yeah, there's a lot of body polishing to be done here, but
[1805.66s - 1810.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um, but really thinking about what we're you know where we're trying to go here right now
[1810.00s - 1814.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So you know low pH means minimal ion exchange minimal processing
[1814.08s - 1816.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Makes it easier to interface with the chemical step
[1816.56s - 1823.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I mean if you've ever tried to work on a process that's done a process that's done on neutral pH and then move it over to a
[1823.30s - 1828.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: uh, uh, uh thermal chemical step or a year they're at you know very high pH or very low pH
[1828.66s - 1830.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: It is extremely difficult
[1830.10s - 1835.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So having the biology working at as low pH as possible is is really advantageous
[1836.46s - 1836.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[1837.24s - 1842.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: The and then you know that just helps together that sets you out to say take real both question do we that we want to give
[1842.74s - 1843.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: uh
[1843.94s - 1852.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: You know a range of the pH, you know what we know our black that got to is that gonna strengthen or getting on need that specificity
[1853.06s - 1859.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: I think we'd be good to talk about that and I think that's a bit comparative too especially to what's all spend done
[1859.10s - 1865.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um, I believe it looked like uh that the previous cargo technology and their low pH they were rebuilding it
[1865.94s - 1870.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think somebody had it up run and you had it I think was like three and a half and we were going down
[1870.46s - 1873.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We were going down and we were going down to about two and a half
[1873.48s - 1875.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: Uh, yeah, of course, the two and a half yet
[1875.90s - 1876.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, okay
[1876.98s - 1879.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: A lot of the new pH is the big deal
[1879.80s - 1883.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: So yeah, and then I can I'm sorry to say now I can I can poke around
[1884.60s - 1890.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: uh, fermentation folks to put something together about you know giving up a general idea of how to find that media wise
[1890.60s - 1893.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: You know what you don't put in what you don't have to pull out so
[1894.50s - 1896.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: And I'll make sure pH gets into two. Okay, thanks, man
[1897.34s - 1901.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, and then yeah, then the other part about it is one of the big learnings is the mineral media lead media right
[1901.60s - 1907.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So don't put it in if you don't want to take it out um, and that's the has big big part here. It's so yeah, we'll find hope for that
[1908.56s - 1908.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: if
[1909.98s - 1918.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, just maybe I didn't say it upfront, but you know the the best defined by the FOA the minimum what we need to demonstrate is one kilogram of
[1919.12s - 1924.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Of a final come out of a final material of a currently of commerce
[1924.10s - 1931.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So beetle act related with fit that definition. So we need to produce one kilogram of beetle act relate that then is a value a
[1931.42s - 1939.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: It by industry standard or other kind of or methods that we define as to be a drop-in or an equivalent to the petrochemical version
[1939.54s - 1943.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So that's the that is you know that that's what we're that's what we're marching to at the end
[1944.22s - 1944.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[1945.22s - 1950.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So he end to wealth at fantasy what's what's in what's out for the kind of some pieces of that right now
[1950.44s - 1953.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think you know we're going to leave the you would playadian would plan on leaving the cell engineering
[1954.10s - 1960.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Out of scope, but we would work on taking kind of a current candidate through hp organism
[1960.40s - 1963.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: In scope and developing the fermentation stuff tied to that
[1964.10s - 1970.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um, and then obviously the DSP in the chemistry is all gonna have to probably be you know be in scope
[1970.08s - 1975.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: There's some steps that a little bit more obvious than others. So we'll be well to say how that all stacks up
[1975.94s - 1982.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But it will have some level demonstration on all of them, but we'll have to put it all together at the end and make a kilogram look beetle act relate so
[1984.10s - 1984.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[1986.76s - 1989.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Let's see. I think Brandon was this your section here?
[1991.26s - 1992.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_14/SPEAKER_17/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, yeah, this is uh
[1993.46s - 1994.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: Anything you want to talk for you're good
[1995.20s - 2001.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_14/SPEAKER_17: Yeah, and you know, I think you and uh you and Brad touched on it and Christian touched on it pretty well
[2001.00s - 2002.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: A little bit of this will be redundant
[2002.98s - 2006.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: It basically speaks to the
[2007.58s - 2008.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: uh
[2009.28s - 2012.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: High productivity strain the optimized fermentation
[2012.14s - 2018.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: I mentioned CSL, but I don't go specifically in what the bind media is and you know how that impacts the DSP
[2019.60s - 2025.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: And then it up you know sort of a high level as as you've mentioned the try to trying to integrate the
[2026.56s - 2028.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: dehydration and捨ification reactions
[2029.36s - 2035.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: As much as possible with the sp to create the most depiction, you know overall process from
[2035.38s - 2036.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: the
[2036.76s - 2044.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: So sort of the purest fermentation e can make it's it's a lot of what you already mentioned and then you know specifically
[2046.54s - 2054.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: Using that process that that we've created with the with the optimized strains produce a kilogram that's verified by sure when at the end
[2059.10s - 2060.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: Yeah, this whole
[2061.02s - 2064.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_14: Probably needs to be combined with the upper section a little bit some of this stuff
[2064.34s - 2069.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_14/SPEAKER_17: Put in a little little more than we've been we probably need but so is easier to take out
[2071.46s - 2074.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_14/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, I haven't I haven't started cutting sentences yet. I've been rearranging paragraphs
[2074.92s - 2079.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I've not been kind of rearranging sentences yet, so but that's my one two next things to start working here. So
[2080.62s - 2080.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[2081.70s - 2085.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I'll then you know other you know kind of what we can put in here um
[2087.26s - 2088.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That note is about um
[2088.90s - 2093.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, we've got so like I think we've kind of covered a lot of this in in the previous text
[2093.56s - 2093.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[2095.76s - 2102.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know, it's I think it's concepts we might look for you know, I think the continuous just you know continuous distillation or some sort of
[2102.26s - 2109.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Reactive distillation is kind of where we think probably is the close to be I think that's going to also depend a little bit on IP and what we think you know
[2110.36s - 2113.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: What we can find about the problems of some of the things that people have developed
[2115.32s - 2115.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The
[2117.68s - 2121.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know the you know kind of you know, there's a wide range excessive condition to convert it
[2121.98s - 2127.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That now to give it three hp acrylic. I mean it's the end that the chemistry is 10 is template before the chemistry right and I think as I
[2127.44s - 2134.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know, I don't know we need to make that point too strongly, but it is but it does it's very nice because it opens up a range
[2134.34s - 2138.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: A huge range of possible ways to convert the three hp to acrylic
[2139.36s - 2143.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Which makes a lot more options as far as doing something that's a little more fit for purpose, right? So
[2143.94s - 2144.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[2149.44s - 2153.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Was your concept to do the dehydration and esterification all
[2154.52s - 2155.12s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Simultaneously
[2155.90s - 2160.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That that is yes that that looks to we we um
[2160.90s - 2168.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That is very interesting and I think that is kind of what we would propose is the core um we did find there is a bsf patent from
[2168.76s - 2174.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Like 20 and front 2021 that does how that does include that
[2175.00s - 2181.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think we need to understand more detail understanding what that would be limiting
[2181.02s - 2186.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: What how limiting that would be from from a view or kind of what or how different
[2186.08s - 2191.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know or again, we have kind of what that what that would be from a blocking that would be
[2192.16s - 2192.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[2193.08s - 2197.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I in general though I mean in in general reactive distillations of esters are not
[2197.82s - 2202.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Very uncommon. It's we even dehydrated once right so I think and there's and we know of there's also
[2202.52s - 2205.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: literature to describe to basically this reaction
[2205.04s - 2206.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know going way back so
[2207.40s - 2211.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know how enforceable that patent is is you know not I guess not for us to decide but um
[2211.80s - 2215.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But it's just how how how you know from the terms of
[2215.76s - 2221.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: How our ability to actually practice it will probably be the bigger question or ability to kind of build a project around it
[2221.36s - 2222.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But yes, I think
[2223.42s - 2226.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: From from a from a point of view of simplifying things
[2227.10s - 2232.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: A or the few the fewest number of steps in kind of doing the most work in the steps uh
[2232.76s - 2236.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And a dehydrative stratification is would would be ideal
[2236.52s - 2241.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And it's in it and literature wise as it works pretty well or should work pretty well
[2241.02s - 2245.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_18: It's all good and but it's gonna be the details right so it's gonna be all you put your pure
[2246.02s - 2247.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That's gonna be the
[2247.74s - 2252.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think the project is significantly about those impurities because a lot of the
[2252.70s - 2253.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Are
[2253.64s - 2258.84s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Yeah, we've been we've been looking at that same patent in the context of some of the other new monomers
[2258.84s - 2260.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: We've been we've been developing
[2261.88s - 2265.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: And I don't know we've almost concluded they must have abandoned that for some reason
[2266.44s - 2266.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: um
[2267.54s - 2269.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: And we can talk about that a little bit more later because
[2269.96s - 2274.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Some of the monomers are or not really public yet that we're interested in
[2274.84s - 2275.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: um
[2275.84s - 2281.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: But but yeah, we definitely have some advances we made in those in those areas that might be applicable here
[2282.04s - 2282.38s] Speaker Unknown: um
[2283.76s - 2289.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: What are some of the other contaminants that are going to be in these broths? Do we know that? Is that well defined yet?
[2289.78s - 2290.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: uh
[2290.84s - 2293.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Brennan oh and christian you guys want to talk about impurities
[2299.46s - 2302.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Uh, yeah, okay, I can take it so from end of fermentation
[2303.32s - 2307.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: It's what you would think it's the acetate that we're concerned about right that
[2307.30s - 2314.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: That we worked on our lactic strain to get down to you know like less than 2% total. It's uh glycerol ethanol
[2316.84s - 2318.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: um acetate
[2318.00s - 2321.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Uh two three-butane dial you can get that we figured that out
[2321.16s - 2325.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: pyrupe um, so you're looking at mono acids and some
[2325.88s - 2327.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: sugar alcoves
[2327.64s - 2332.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_08: Okay, and the biggest hit on our yield for lactic was actually
[2332.08s - 2333.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: bio-crispy growth
[2333.66s - 2336.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: But we can control that through process
[2337.76s - 2340.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Then obviously we a little bit of amino acids and things like that that would
[2340.96s - 2343.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: rob yield and we would try to make the trend do the uh
[2343.94s - 2348.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: your sterification or we with three hp you lose so you lose some to the
[2348.58s - 2350.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: The things like that if you don't have to remove
[2350.60s - 2359.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: But I think that I think that that can be in scope for the process right um as far as things that the bugs gonna do to stay alive
[2359.74s - 2365.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Um, you know, you're looking at this sort of the spriegum flyers um auto acids. We don't see we do a little bit right now
[2365.56s - 2368.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: But we we have uh, we think we've got our
[2368.56s - 2373.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: Hand uh handle on it. It's our diacid so he like now it's from america since like that
[2373.52s - 2378.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_18: Okay, yeah, and queserals of big one right that's a big yield that we have big if you think about ways
[2378.58s - 2385.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, you lose three hp queserals of big one and that one has been sick and it was it was also a problem with the lactic project in the way you process lactic
[2385.08s - 2390.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So that queserals has been has been pretty well mitigated in the in the chassis
[2390.62s - 2394.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, we got it around one percent of total fermentation so
[2396.54s - 2400.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: And do we have tighter and yield targets for this?
[2402.50s - 2408.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think it's gonna depend um what we'll put something into the proposal um, but yeah
[2408.76s - 2412.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We have we'd have some things that we can take over from our bigger from the bigger project around it
[2412.88s - 2418.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Again, we're not probably going to do take the you know, we're not probably put the full cell engineering work into the project
[2418.14s - 2423.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We'll probably take a get pick a candidate and we'll have that candidate. We'll know what that one is
[2423.34s - 2428.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And we probably will have some maybe we'll probably put some sort of process that we got to we have a
[2428.08s - 2430.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Improvement we want to bring to the project will bring along
[2430.42s - 2435.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But it is gonna have to be something that we'll have to have something that at least there's a reason that's standard for
[2436.58s - 2442.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: A um full production organism um to show the economics or show some or show some level of the
[2442.88s - 2446.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: economics where we're only taking this to you know, this is probably a
[2446.88s - 2452.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Probably a TRL, you know for you know, probably advancing from four to five
[2452.22s - 2457.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Maybe six right so we're not really taking it very far and there this is a fairly early state
[2457.10s - 2463.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The way the structure is pretty good right so they don't they only want a kilo at the end so it's up essentially all bench work
[2463.54s - 2470.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So me know taking it from you know taking it from early four to eight five probably is reasonable for
[2470.02s - 2472.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: For the scope of what they have for funding. So
[2475.74s - 2480.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Today's one of preliminary T.E.A. in the concept paper or just in the application
[2481.54s - 2488.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Just in the application. I think we have enough that we'll I'll write them with a paragraph around that um kind of with full demonstrated
[2489.46s - 2492.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Uh yields and titers using lactic as a standard, you know again
[2492.40s - 2499.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We right now part of the justification for us is we think that this is that we'll be able to do basically what we did with lactic with
[2499.24s - 2500.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_17/SPEAKER_18: three hv so
[2506.38s - 2511.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: And how feet stocked specific are they they had like an appendix of
[2512.44s - 2520.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Well in in in the in the text they say that they they go ahead and say that um dextrose from corn is preferred so
[2520.76s - 2521.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Okay
[2522.88s - 2525.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Why's nothing about whole kernel corn?
[2525.94s - 2530.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, it's whole kernel corn but i mean that mean yeah so that that's the way they phrase it but okay
[2532.80s - 2536.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That we can talk we can talk through that piece of it be either it's
[2536.76s - 2539.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: It's the dextrose from all kernel corn i mean they if they want that yeah
[2542.06s - 2542.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That's
[2543.12s - 2547.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You can make it yeah that i think that's just an antics
[2548.36s - 2553.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Okay, if they want this to be like a uh ethanol a dry mill of an all fermentation that's probably not happening so
[2556.34s - 2557.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The way too messy
[2562.50s - 2567.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So and that's not the way i read i think they just i think they're just basically saying corn is in scope and that was car
[2567.14s - 2572.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_03/SPEAKER_18: I'll call your interpretation as well as that it was just you know corn is in scope usually they just exclude it
[2573.62s - 2578.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Exactly, I was just like you said Eric. I mean not only is it in scope, but it's preferred which kind of made me fall out of my chair
[2578.76s - 2583.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Because it used to be exactly the opposite like don't even bother if it's corn sugar right so yeah
[2585.36s - 2588.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Do you think just in just in the sense of making it
[2590.02s - 2590.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: obvious
[2591.28s - 2592.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Just explicitly
[2593.52s - 2596.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Connecting it to the whole kernel corn
[2597.50s - 2598.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_17: Yeah, it would be
[2600.18s - 2601.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Would be good
[2601.70s - 2604.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_17: Yeah, we do that. I think we can talk about it
[2604.50s - 2610.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_17: I think we have this confluent ad is talking through that the connection to the whole kernel corn that is the dextrose that is derived from all kernel corn
[2611.10s - 2611.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: if
[2613.02s - 2617.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah, to your point Eric Eric Cocker and I think yeah just having the purvage of whole kernel corn
[2617.80s - 2623.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: You know in a wet mill produces corn sugar dextrose and that's going to be you know the food to our our organism
[2623.58s - 2627.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: And I think having having that said specifically so people don't even have to think about it
[2627.46s - 2630.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: They just read and they go okay check because it put your right it probably is a check bot somewhere
[2631.34s - 2635.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Yeah, and that's just my experience the proposals as you don't leave anything as a
[2635.88s - 2637.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Well, they should know that
[2639.20s - 2640.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: No reading between the lines
[2641.78s - 2642.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Exactly
[2648.30s - 2652.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Brennan did you think anything you wanted to add on this or we talked through the section
[2654.08s - 2657.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, yeah, I think we cover whistle. It's in there
[2658.82s - 2663.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um Derek a little bit. I know Derek wrote this this section a little bit
[2663.72s - 2668.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: This is just really kind of talking about some some benchmarking in terms of that
[2668.18s - 2672.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: This is what we're kind of expanding this because this actually gets even rozier than this
[2672.08s - 2674.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: from kind of some from the kind of
[2675.22s - 2679.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Basically unreasonable assumptions of what we what we think is possible comparatively so
[2679.48s - 2683.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: He did a lot of this numbers. I think there he pulled out of s and p
[2683.78s - 2686.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: From the that that's a p database for the pp database
[2686.38s - 2688.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So that's something we can leverage and use
[2689.30s - 2693.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: For this as far as you know talking about numbers that are not just 80 in proprietary
[2693.00s - 2695.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But things that other people can access you know
[2695.24s - 2698.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We've got a subscription, but other people can access and get that same info
[2698.56s - 2704.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So uh makes it makes a nice story as far as um a third party validated data that says hey
[2704.76s - 2711.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: This is this is at these at these yield targets and in things this this is viable against profiling to acrylic
[2711.52s - 2711.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: so
[2714.58s - 2720.18s] Speaker SPEAKER_16/SPEAKER_17/SPEAKER_18: Yep, and I can add more as you want. I kept it short that I can always put in more paragraphs for lines
[2721.02s - 2725.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And then and then part of the we have to capture shoes of the paragraph there's a lot more in here than that
[2725.04s - 2727.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But this will be we'll succeed if our later is the is around
[2728.42s - 2734.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: As risks and Brennan is always great with coming up with project risk. So he's got a good list of started old started year already
[2735.46s - 2741.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um, but um and then metrics that's the one thing we'll have to then we probably need to kind of come up with what are
[2741.98s - 2743.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: How we're going to
[2743.96s - 2749.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: measure this the faux is a little little lacking on usually they usually get more definition on things
[2749.96s - 2757.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: They specifically want to see the one is one is a pretty significant greenhouse gas reduction compared to
[2758.54s - 2763.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Petra petrochemicals and that's something we'll that that is that's that's a non-negotiable one
[2763.06s - 2769.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um the the other one is then making the kilogram but kind of otherwise we'll need to come up with a couple of things
[2769.54s - 2770.58s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: proposed are
[2771.24s - 2774.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: That as as our metrics to measure kind of how successful we are
[2775.54s - 2780.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Something around media composition or something like or kind of or impurities or
[2780.76s - 2785.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: loss of acrylic I I'm not sure exactly what we need to do there I need to read that that again
[2785.08s - 2789.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But if people have ideas um kind of metrics on you know on that you know
[2790.18s - 2794.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Before that we will need to kind of propose some of there and that's the one that's one piece
[2794.20s - 2796.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I know that that deserves some more thought
[2798.20s - 2802.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, yeah, and that's that's that's kind of where that's the state of the draft right now um
[2802.24s - 2809.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I guess comments people things things that are missing in the narrative things that are you know thoughts um in terms of
[2809.60s - 2815.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um, you know a different tack that we you know think you know people agree we're kind of on the right track
[2815.56s - 2819.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: People under now kind of um, yeah any questions I guess
[2824.92s - 2827.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: Eric since we're naming
[2827.70s - 2827.72s] Speaker Unknown: um
[2829.62s - 2835.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: Udall acrolyte is being the the target is you think there's going to be any expectation that
[2835.82s - 2838.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: that we have to speak to the I don't know to
[2839.38s - 2841.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: potential bio base
[2841.72s - 2843.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: component of butanol or
[2844.78s - 2849.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, that that's come off. I think we'll need and I think that one I want to include just by
[2849.38s - 2854.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: kind of reference essentially that you know there is biobase there's initiatives around biobase people
[2854.74s - 2855.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[2856.30s - 2859.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We can you know, you know, there's there's technologies out there available
[2859.68s - 2868.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We've we've got a we've got basically you know just kneeling. I worked on a bio-based butanol grant here that was um
[2869.36s - 2875.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know time using Givo technology. So I think there's there's things out there and I and my my proposal is that we would
[2876.34s - 2878.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Is that we would um use
[2879.06s - 2883.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We would basically leverage that rather than including the bio-based butanol in scope
[2883.94s - 2885.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You know, I am being problem with that
[2886.36s - 2888.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: Oh, I was thinking along the same lines
[2888.44s - 2888.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: I
[2889.48s - 2891.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: In my mind I had in my mind
[2891.62s - 2897.12s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: I think like Eastman had acquired some bio-based and Udall fermentation technology
[2897.74s - 2900.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: I don't know 10-15 years ago or something like that
[2900.16s - 2907.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: But exactly like what you're saying can we if we could just reference that and and take that as a sort of a given that might be
[2908.42s - 2909.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_15: A good way to do it
[2913.98s - 2919.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_15/SPEAKER_18: I think there's enough out there that we can say on that that you know, again, there's a bio-based and U knowledge, you know is
[2920.30s - 2928.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_04/SPEAKER_15/SPEAKER_18: Is doable right some right right there's a reason to like expectations that you can do that and so we're not gonna spend our time trying to think about that so
[2932.60s - 2938.70s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: But would it hurt us in any way that you know, whatever our target commercial targets for three hpr
[2938.70s - 2946.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Those need to be matched by bio-based butanol production globally bright and I don't know if those scales are similar or not
[2946.22s - 2951.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_02/SPEAKER_18: Is that something that should be addressed? I think not not at the TRL stages of this project
[2951.78s - 2956.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think again it's showing it's showing that this is you know if you think about it
[2956.06s - 2960.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: This is you know, where's this the heart of this project is gonna be TRL 4 so this is really showing feasibility
[2960.98s - 2965.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_04/SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_18: That's right feasibility book pieces together. Okay. Yeah, thanks
[2966.30s - 2970.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Eric it will have an impact on the TGA is TGA part of this
[2971.92s - 2972.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_04/SPEAKER_18: uh
[2972.96s - 2978.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Do they work? It is and I think we can leverage some of the things that we did right so we will have we'll have
[2978.68s - 2982.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_04/SPEAKER_18: People will have those kind of Fimsy project will have kind of TGA numbers we can do so
[2985.62s - 2989.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_04/SPEAKER_09: Yeah bio-based will be a little bit more expensive right so yeah
[2998.24s - 3004.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um other other questions thoughts. I don't know Morgan you've done a lot of you've done a lot of these anything anything that's
[3005.42s - 3005.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: your
[3006.56s - 3007.98s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: concerns your questions
[3010.78s - 3017.90s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Eric not so much a concern it's just more as you said a question at this stage you've not done
[3018.66s - 3028.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: This document as written does not speak to the I guess performance evaluation the work that Sherwin Williams would do other than
[3028.32s - 3032.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: peripherally mentioning it so I just want to confirm at this stage
[3032.42s - 3037.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: You're not expecting significant writing or content from Sherwin you don't think it's necessary
[3039.02s - 3047.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think we probably need to probably just need a few sentences from you guys on that performance evaluation and it probably goes to the end targets and
[3048.44s - 3054.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Metrics probably right I think that's pretty again in terms of what what are we what are we looking to achieve at the end?
[3054.20s - 3058.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: What are the key measurable things that we need to demonstrate at the end?
[3058.74s - 3062.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um and I think I think we probably need some of your input on that
[3062.68s - 3065.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um and then I think the other part would be the
[3066.56s - 3073.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Would be the just bio just the just the importance of beetle acrolyte as a target right or as a target molecule
[3073.48s - 3079.88s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And why what what would be the what would be the drivers um you know sustainability is one obviously
[3079.88s - 3085.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But what would be additional drivers as far as you know again thinking about just kind of current political environment in terms of
[3086.44s - 3091.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Supply chain and domestic production and things like that right if is there is there any drivers there
[3091.82s - 3095.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We connect to as a far as beetle acrolyte if not I don't think it's killer
[3095.66s - 3100.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But be great if we can kind of have some there's some narrative that kind of ties to that and so
[3101.52s - 3102.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_09: Okay
[3105.18s - 3111.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And then obviously as we get into the if you get into the text and you're guys input on the just the just from a chemistry point of
[3111.26s - 3115.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You would be awesome as well right so you guys different view of different view of the chemistry world than we do
[3115.78s - 3120.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So um anything that you that you you know um as we start mapping out
[3120.44s - 3126.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Because this will miss a map out a little bit in terms of preferred preferred scenarios is kind of before we think the chemistry goes
[3126.68s - 3129.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um you guys have a different view or you know something we don't
[3129.40s - 3134.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Please feel free to time chime in on that as well. So again, and if you be adding
[3135.16s - 3140.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: From a point of view of just like the as we were talking about the reactive distillation as kind of the
[3141.42s - 3146.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: The you know or you just there you have the dehydration and sterilization distillation kind of all the one thing if that's
[3146.40s - 3150.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We think that's a bridge too far. Um, please uh, please speak up. So
[3154.76s - 3155.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: You
[3155.36s - 3159.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: You wouldn't argue me you can make about butanol is it's a domestic product today
[3159.70s - 3164.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: And it's emerging as as a potentially cost competitive bio based product
[3164.98s - 3168.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: And it I mean it's uh, it's a propylene derivative, right
[3169.62s - 3172.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_17: Yeah, so that means it's natural gas
[3172.94s - 3175.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: sourced as well as nap the sourced
[3175.20s - 3176.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: and
[3178.32s - 3179.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_07: So children team
[3179.54s - 3182.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_07: We also consider ethanol
[3184.72s - 3190.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Ethanol means ethanol is obviously a clear easier cut. I know you know, yeah, I think Mary can you say that?
[3190.78s - 3197.32s] Speaker SPEAKER_10/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, so I mean ethanol so we're utilizing this in Europe bioethanol today
[3197.84s - 3199.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: Ethanol is not as
[3199.08s - 3202.22s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_09/SPEAKER_10: robustly used in coatings
[3203.00s - 3208.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: Formulas that there are some manufacturing challenges around the the odor. I think somebody mentioned about the acrolytes was
[3208.74s - 3214.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: specifically ethyl acrolyte so we don't utilize that in a large degree in North America
[3216.50s - 3220.20s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: Not that it wouldn't like we would have to convert a lot of formulas
[3220.20s - 3225.60s] Speaker SPEAKER_10: Vuelacrolyte itself would be essentially a drop-in to existing formula
[3226.52s - 3226.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_10/SPEAKER_18: Yeah
[3231.06s - 3231.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah
[3231.46s - 3233.42s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, I think that's I think that's the kind of thing that
[3237.58s - 3239.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Ethanol the butanol is a thing
[3240.52s - 3249.48s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, there's plenty I think there again, I think the will point is there's whether it's at by a butanol directly by fermentation or ethanol the butanol or those those are all
[3249.48s - 3257.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Those are all you know viable known technologies, right? So I think that says I would cast that as substantially solved at this point
[3257.26s - 3262.04s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: It's just about having enough of a poll on the bio-based butanol market to do some of those things
[3262.04s - 3269.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: I think from a technical perspective in terms of manufacturing you might have some advantages with butanol in that once it's
[3269.64s - 3271.64s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Once it's on the acid you've
[3271.64s - 3278.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Increased the the hydrophobicity quite a bit and so it's gonna be a lot easier to get out of the aqueous phase
[3279.88s - 3282.08s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Agreed that's one of one of our thoughts as well
[3284.64s - 3285.04s] Speaker Unknown: I
[3285.04s - 3291.28s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Need to set sets the set the chemistry up better I think from a we're kind of what we want to do as far as making everything simple and easy
[3304.30s - 3305.82s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Yeah, coming up um
[3306.70s - 3310.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Here, I guess I don't know that we have any major writing assignments
[3310.26s - 3316.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I guess the only one Morgan would be if you've got anything just kind of on on metro what we want to measure at the end
[3316.02s - 3319.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We'll write up there and then anything and now on the point about the
[3320.70s - 3322.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Pudel acrolate as a
[3322.84s - 3328.10s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Of has the target right so the dry don't talk a little bit about the drivers or the around Pudel acrolate is the target
[3328.10s - 3336.68s] Speaker SPEAKER_00/SPEAKER_18: I think you know MJ's comment about it's dropping right is a big one right so it's I it's it's minimizes disruption and and investment needed so
[3337.32s - 3338.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_14/SPEAKER_17: but right
[3340.12s - 3345.62s] Speaker SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_08: Okay, I think other metrics that made not have been mentioned yet would be like lca
[3347.32s - 3350.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: Type of metrics so energy consumption
[3353.10s - 3354.34s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: GHD GHG
[3354.34s - 3356.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Yeah, I'll hold that good stuff
[3356.30s - 3364.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Here the GHD reduction metric baked into the foye so it's a meaning we need a 70% reduction in GHG compared to the petrochemical process
[3364.76s - 3367.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Which is a pretty steep one, but um
[3367.94s - 3371.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But I think then that's going to be substantially feedstock um
[3371.38s - 3373.78s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Try it on that right so it's going to have to be low
[3373.78s - 3376.52s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Low GHG corn going into it which
[3377.24s - 3381.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Well, we have to we at 80m use to put that narrative together because that's the but
[3381.36s - 3384.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I mean we have that we've done a frick of other things
[3387.36s - 3391.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But overall energy things are going to be important and water water reductions
[3391.14s - 3395.44s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think to your point Eric as far as making sure that we stay as low as possible right so
[3404.32s - 3408.36s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Okay, um anything else for the good of the order um with I think by the way
[3408.36s - 3413.30s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think we um we can go ahead and wrap up but we'll get um if people have feedback on the text right now
[3413.30s - 3418.38s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Please you can put it said into me, but we'll work on getting a sharepoint set up with everyone added to it
[3418.38s - 3420.86s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: So that we can call collaborate on drafts
[3421.44s - 3427.00s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: And you make it so we're not sending emails around with um think maybe you got current feedback just right now feel free to send it
[3427.00s - 3428.02s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We'll get that incorporated
[3428.70s - 3429.14s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um
[3429.14s - 3434.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But uh last that you know what we're gonna get you guys get a folder set up and get a shared for everybody to
[3434.92s - 3441.46s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: To be able to collaborate on a single document and as this week we're gonna be working on refining this and the
[3441.46s - 3447.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Refining this into a fine into a final final submission and ideally get it submitted mid mid week next week
[3447.92s - 3449.50s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But head of the 14th so
[3450.86s - 3450.86s] Speaker Unknown: 
[3453.66s - 3454.54s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Great sounds good
[3455.34s - 3466.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Now just do you think it will remind me what's the next process to wait for DOE to provide feedback on these whether or not to proceed or do we keep do we start working on the full proposal that would be due in May
[3467.30s - 3471.66s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think we need to start well I think we need to start outlining the full proposal um
[3472.26s - 3477.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: um and uh because just the time frame I think it um it would that would be what I recommend
[3478.24s - 3483.16s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Is we to we right now with DOE was going on we have no idea when they'll get it if they're gonna get it
[3483.16s - 3487.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: You can get around to getting encouraged discouraging so um be shocking if they don't
[3488.34s - 3492.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, but they may just not have bandwidth to get those out till late in the process um
[3493.26s - 3499.76s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Right and again, we're kind of thinking that they're based on everything we've seen so far that some of these deadlines are probably gonna have to move
[3499.76s - 3501.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Just from their staffing point of view
[3501.80s - 3505.56s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But we'll have to see we we don't know so until we hear differently
[3505.56s - 3508.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: We're gonna start marching towards that that may submission time frame and so
[3509.80s - 3514.26s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: I think start as soon as we get this proposed as soon as we get the concept paper done start working on the proposal
[3515.72s - 3516.92s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Okay, sounds great
[3516.92s - 3526.94s] Speaker SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_08: Yeah, just from an administrative point of view it takes ios state about a month ahead of proposing submission deadline to do anything where we need to show cost share
[3527.56s - 3528.06s] Speaker Unknown: Okay
[3528.58s - 3532.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: So if if you're asking us to do cost share we can we can do some of that
[3532.72s - 3537.12s] Speaker SPEAKER_08: But there's the time constraint is the only fine print there
[3537.82s - 3543.40s] Speaker SPEAKER_08/SPEAKER_18: Okay, yeah, and I don't know that it's needed in this case, but um, we can talk about that error because it's fine but again
[3543.92s - 3546.80s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: But yeah, we need to get that started being probably get that going here sooner than later
[3555.00s - 3556.96s] Speaker SPEAKER_18: Um, cool anything else
[3556.96s - 3561.74s] Speaker SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_18: I think we're good from the show inside. Thank you Eric
[3562.42s - 3566.24s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Thanks to the adm team for putting together. Yeah, so far. It's a good
[3566.88s - 3567.72s] Speaker SPEAKER_05: Thank you, babe
[3568.96s - 3573.06s] Speaker SPEAKER_05/SPEAKER_08: Yeah, likewise. This is great. Thanks Eric. Bye bye. Thanks guys
