## Policy

- Keep the roles separate:
  - roadmap: master plan, priority map, and lane catalog
  - runbook: dated turn log of what happened
  - progress ledger: completed-history record
- Treat `ROADMAP.md` as the master plan and revise it cautiously.
- Do not materially reorder, rename, or reprioritize roadmap lanes unless the user explicitly asks for that change, or unless a narrow correction is required to unblock already-requested work.
- Use one canonical top-level roadmap item naming convention, for example `P## | <Lane Title>`, rather than mixing free-form phases, lanes, and milestones.
- If duplicated status text drifts, the roadmap and runbook win over stale summaries elsewhere.
- For any roadmap lane in an active state such as `OPEN`, include a short `Current State` note that says what already exists and what still remains.
- New plan artifacts must live under `docs/dev/plans/` and be wired into both the roadmap and the runbook before they are treated as active.
- For any roadmap lane in an active state such as `OPEN`, require at least one actionable plan unless the lane is being closed in the same slice.
- If a feature does not fit an existing lane, update the roadmap first and make the priority decision explicit.
- Plan wiring and plan-state semantics should be auditable by deterministic helpers rather than relying on chat history or inference.
- After a planning-contract migration for an active repo, record one dated review note or runbook entry that captures the migration, semantic mismatches found, and refinements required.
- Treat progress/history files as retrospective, not planning authority.
- When append-only plans or runbook history become too large for fast authority
  recovery, maintain a compact current-head projection of active lanes, latest
  checkpoint evidence, blockers, and next actions. The projection may be
  generated, but it must link back to the canonical ledger and must not replace
  or rewrite history.

## Adoption Notes

Use this module when the repo already carries multiple planning files or has suffered planning drift.
